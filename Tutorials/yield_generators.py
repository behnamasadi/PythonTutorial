#The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off.

#Yield are used in Python generators. A generator function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
