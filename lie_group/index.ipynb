    "## Group\n",
    "In mathematics, a **group** is a set, equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element, satisfying four fundamental axioms. Here's the formal definition and its properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ G $ be a set and $ \\cdot $ be a binary operation on $ G $ (i.e., a function $ \\cdot: G \\times G \\rightarrow G $). Then $ (G, \\cdot) $ is called a group if the following axioms are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closure**: For every pair of elements $ a, b $ in $ G $, the result of the operation $ a \\cdot b $ is also in $ G $.\n",
    "   $ \\forall a, b \\in G, \\quad a \\cdot b \\in G $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Associativity**: For all elements $ a, b, $ and $ c $ in $ G $, the equation $ (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c) $ holds.\n",
    "   $ \\forall a, b, c \\in G, \\quad (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c) $\n",

    "3. **Identity Element**: There exists an element $ e $ in $ G $ such that for every element $ a $ in $ G $, the equation $ e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a $ holds.\n",
    "   $ \\exists e \\in G \\quad \\forall a \\in G, \\quad e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a $\n",

    "   $ \\forall a \\in G, \\quad \\exists b \\in G \\quad \\text{such that} \\quad a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e $\n",

    "If a group also satisfies the **commutative** property:\n",
    "$ \\forall a, b \\in G, \\quad a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a $\n",

    "1. The set of integers $ \\mathbb{Z} $ with the operation of addition is a group. The identity element is 0, and the inverse of any integer $ n $ is $ -n $.\n",
    "2. The set of non-zero real numbers $ \\mathbb{R}^* $ with the operation of multiplication is a group. The identity element is 1, and the inverse of any real number $ r $ is $ 1/r $.\n",

    "Formally, the **affine group** $ \\text{Aff}(V) $ on a vector space $ V $ over a field $ F $ is the group of all invertible affine transformations from $ V $ to itself. An affine transformation can be thought of as the composition of a linear transformation and a translation.\n",
