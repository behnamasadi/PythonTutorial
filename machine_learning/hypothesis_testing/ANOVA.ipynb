    "## **1. What is ANOVA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANOVA** stands for **Analysis of Variance**.\n",
    "It’s a statistical method used to test **whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It compares **group means** by analyzing **variance** (spread) in the data.\n",
    "* It determines if the variation **between groups** is significantly larger than the variation **within groups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It’s like saying: “Are these groups really different, or is the difference just due to random chance?”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Why not just use t-tests?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only had **two groups**, a **t-test** works fine.\n",
    "But if you have **three or more groups**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You *could* run multiple t-tests, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Problem 1:** You increase the chance of **Type I error** (false positives) with each extra test.\n",
    "  * **Problem 2:** You don’t get one unified conclusion — you end up with many pairwise results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANOVA solves this** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Testing all groups at once with a **single hypothesis test**.\n",
    "* Controlling the overall Type I error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. When do we need ANOVA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should consider ANOVA when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have **one categorical independent variable** (factor) with **3+ levels** (groups).\n",
    "* You have **one continuous dependent variable** (like height, weight, score).\n",
    "* You want to know if the means differ across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comparing **average test scores** for students taught with 3 different teaching methods.\n",
    "* Comparing **mean plant growth** under 4 fertilizer types.\n",
    "* Comparing **average reaction times** for people in different age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. The Problem ANOVA Solves**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Are differences between group means statistically significant, or could they be explained by random variation within the groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by splitting total variation into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Between-group variance** (differences caused by the group factor)\n",
    "2. **Within-group variance** (natural differences inside each group)\n",
    "\n",
    "If **between-group variance** is much larger than **within-group variance**, it suggests that the factor (grouping) actually matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. How it Works (Conceptually)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Sum of Squares (SST)** → total variation in all data.\n",
    "* **Between-Group Sum of Squares (SSB)** → variation due to group differences.\n",
    "* **Within-Group Sum of Squares (SSW)** → variation due to random noise inside groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\text{Mean Square Between}}{\\text{Mean Square Within}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large **F-value** → more likely groups are truly different.\n",
    "* Compare **F** to a critical value (or get p-value) to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Types of ANOVA**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-way ANOVA** → One factor, multiple groups.\n",
    "* **Two-way ANOVA** → Two factors (can check interaction effects).\n",
    "* **Repeated measures ANOVA** → When the *same subjects* are measured multiple times.\n",
