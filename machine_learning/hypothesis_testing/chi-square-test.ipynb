    "The **Chi-Square Test** is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant relationship between **categorical variables** or whether the observed data fit an **expected distribution**.\n",

    "## **1. Why We Need It**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world situations, our data isn’t numerical like heights or weights — it’s **categorical**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nominal data** (no natural order): gender, color, brand choice, product category.\n",
    "* **Ordinal data** (has order but not equal spacing): customer satisfaction ratings (\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test helps us answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *\"Are these differences just due to random chance?\"*\n",
    "* *\"Do these variables actually have a meaningful association?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **2. The Problems It Solves**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Testing Independence (Chi-Square Test of Independence)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checks if two categorical variables are related.\n",
    "* Example: Is **gender** related to **brand preference**?\n",
    "  If men and women choose brands differently enough (statistically), we can say the variables are **dependent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem it solves:** Helps us know whether two factors influence each other, which is crucial in marketing, surveys, epidemiology, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Testing Goodness of Fit (Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checks if observed data fits an expected distribution.\n",
    "* Example: A fair die should have each face appear **1/6 of the time**. Roll it 60 times — does the observed frequency match the expectation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem it solves:** Detects whether your observed distribution significantly deviates from what theory predicts.\n",

    "$$\n",

    "3. The bigger the difference between O and E, the larger the Chi-square statistic.\n",
    "4. Compare this statistic to a **Chi-square distribution** (depends on **degrees of freedom**) to get a **p-value**.\n",
    "5. Small p-value (< 0.05) → differences are unlikely due to chance → reject null hypothesis.\n",

    "* **Manufacturing**: Do defect types occur in expected proportions?\n",
