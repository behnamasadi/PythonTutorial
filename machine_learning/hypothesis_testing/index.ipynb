    "##  What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing** is a statistical method to decide whether there’s enough evidence in your data to support a specific claim about a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** It helps you decide between “nothing interesting is going on” vs. “there is a real effect.”\n",
    "* **Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Make a claim (Null Hypothesis $H_0$ and Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$).\n",
    "  2. Collect data.\n",
    "  3. Use a statistical test (t-test, z-test, etc.).\n",
    "  4. Compare the test result to a threshold (**p-value** or **critical value**).\n",
    "  5. Conclude whether to reject $H_0$ or not.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)\n",
    "\n",
