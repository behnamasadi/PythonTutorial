    "##  What Is a t-Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **t-test** is a **statistical hypothesis test** used to compare **means**. It used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It's useful when you're dealing with **small sample sizes (n < 30)** and **don't know the population standard deviation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**It helps answer questions like:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Is the average score in Group A significantly different from Group B?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **Assumptions** for t-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data should be approximately **normally distributed** (especially with small n).\n",
    "2. Variance between groups should be **equal** (esp. for independent t-tests, otherwise use Welch’s t-test).\n",
    "3. Observations are **independent** (except in paired t-test).\n",

    "Used to compare the **mean of a single group against** a **known value (mean)**.\n",

    "Used to compare the means of **two unrelated (independent) groups**, used to determine if there is a significant difference between them. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
