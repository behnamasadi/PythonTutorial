    "When the variables are discrete  we may think of the factors $p(x_i\\mid x_{A_i})$ as probability tables. rows correspond to assignments to $x_{A_i}$ and columns correspond to values of $x_i$. the entries contain the actual probabilities $p(x_i\\mid x_{A_i})$\n",

    "1. **Prior Probability $P(H)$**: This represents our initial belief about the probability of a hypothesis $H$ before we see any new data or evidence. It reflects what we know about the situation prior to the latest information.\n",

    "2. **Likelihood $P(E|H)$**: This is the probability of observing the evidence $E$ given that the hypothesis $H$ is true. It measures how likely we are to observe the evidence if the hypothesis holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evidence $P(E)$**: Also known as the marginal likelihood, this is the probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses. It can be calculated by considering all possible states of the world (all hypotheses) and summing or integrating over them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Posterior Probability $P(H|E)$**: This is what Bayesian inference aims to compute - the probability of the hypothesis $H$ after taking into account the new evidence $E$ and our prior belief. This represents our updated belief about the hypothesis in light of the new evidence.\n",
