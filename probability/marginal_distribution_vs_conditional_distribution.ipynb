    "Marginal and conditional distributions are concepts in probability theory and statistics that describe different aspects of the relationship between random variables. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marginal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The marginal distribution of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of that subset, without reference to the values of the other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: If we have two random variables $X$ and $Y$, the marginal distribution of $X$ is the distribution of $X$ when $Y$ is not considered.\n",
    "- **Calculation**: For discrete variables, the marginal probability $P(X=x)$ is obtained by summing the joint probability over all values of $Y$:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  P(X=x) = \\sum_y P(X=x, Y=y)\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  For continuous variables, the marginal density $f_X(x)$ is obtained by integrating the joint density over all values of $Y$:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  f_X(x) = \\int f_{X,Y}(x,y) \\, dy\n",
    "  $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional distribution of a random variable $X$ given another random variable $Y$ describes the distribution of $X$ when $Y$ is known or fixed at a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: The conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y=y$ is the probability distribution of $X$ when $Y$ is known to be $y$.\n",
    "- **Calculation**: For discrete variables, the conditional probability $P(X=x \\mid Y=y)$ is obtained by dividing the joint probability by the marginal probability of $Y$:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  P(X=x \\mid Y=y) = \\frac{P(X=x, Y=y)}{P(Y=y)}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  For continuous variables, the conditional density $f_{X|Y}(x \\mid y)$ is obtained by dividing the joint density by the marginal density of $Y$:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  f_{X|Y}(x \\mid y) = \\frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_Y(y)}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope**:\n",
    "  - **Marginal Distribution**: Focuses on the probability distribution of one variable regardless of the values of other variables.\n",
    "  - **Conditional Distribution**: Focuses on the probability distribution of one variable given that the other variable(s) take specific values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Independence**:\n",
    "  - If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y$ is the same as the marginal distribution of $X$, since knowing $Y$ provides no additional information about $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a joint distribution of two discrete random variables, $X$ and $Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $X$ | $Y$ | $P(X, Y)$ |\n",
    "|------|------|-------------|\n",
    "| 0    | 0    | 0.1         |\n",
    "| 0    | 1    | 0.2         |\n",
    "| 1    | 0    | 0.3         |\n",
    "| 1    | 1    | 0.4         |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marginal Distribution of $X$**:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  P(X=0) = P(X=0, Y=0) + P(X=0, Y=1) = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  P(X=1) = P(X=1, Y=0) + P(X=1, Y=1) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7\n",
    "  $\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional Distribution of $X$ given $Y=1$**:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  P(X=0 \\mid Y=1) = \\frac{P(X=0, Y=1)}{P(Y=1)} = \\frac{0.2}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  P(X=1 \\mid Y=1) = \\frac{P(X=1, Y=1)}{P(Y=1)} = \\frac{0.4}{0.6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the marginal distribution provides a general view of the probability distribution of a single variable, while the conditional distribution provides insight into how one variable behaves given specific values of another variable."
