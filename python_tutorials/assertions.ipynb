{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Assertions in Python are a debugging tool that checks if a condition is true. If the condition is true, the program continues to execute. If it's false, an `AssertionError` is raised, halting the program (unless handled with a `try...except` block).  They are primarily used to catch internal inconsistencies or assumptions in your code during development and testing.  They are *not* intended for handling expected errors like invalid user input.\n\nHere's a breakdown with examples:\n\n**Basic Syntax:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"assert condition, optional_message","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* `condition`: An expression that evaluates to True or False.\n* `optional_message`: A string that is displayed if the assertion fails.  This is helpful for providing context.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. **Simple Assertion:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x = 5\nassert x > 0  # This will pass because x is indeed greater than 0\n\ny = -2\nassert y > 0  # This will raise an AssertionError","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the second case, because `y` is -2 (not greater than 0), the assertion fails, and an `AssertionError` is raised, stopping the program.  You'll typically see a traceback pointing to the line where the assertion failed.\n\n2. **Assertion with a Message:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def divide(a, b):\n    assert b != 0, \"Cannot divide by zero!\"  # More informative message\n    return a / b\n\nresult = divide(10, 2)  # This will work fine\nprint(result)  # Output: 5.0\n\nresult = divide(10, 0)  # This will raise an AssertionError with the specified message","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here, the message \"Cannot divide by zero!\" is displayed along with the `AssertionError`, making it clearer why the assertion failed.\n\n3. **Assertions for Function Preconditions:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def process_data(data):\n    assert isinstance(data, list), \"Data must be a list\"\n    assert all(isinstance(item, int) for item in data), \"List items must be integers\"\n    # ... rest of the function ...","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This example uses assertions to ensure that the input `data` to the `process_data` function meets certain criteria (it's a list and contains only integers).  This helps catch errors early in the development process.\n\n4. **Assertions for Postconditions (Less Common but Useful):**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):\n    assert 0 <= discount_percentage <= 100, \"Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100\"\n    discounted_price = price * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)\n    assert discounted_price <= price, \"Discounted price cannot be greater than original price\" # Postcondition\n    return discounted_price","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here, the second assertion is a *postcondition* â€“ it checks that the `discounted_price` is not greater than the original `price` after the calculation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Assertions are disabled with `-O` or `-OO`:**  When you run Python with the `-O` (optimize) or `-OO` (optimize further) flags (e.g., `python -O my_program.py`), assertions are effectively removed.  This is done for performance reasons in production code.  Therefore, you should *not* rely on assertions for handling errors that might occur in a production environment. Use proper exception handling (`try...except`) for that.\n* **Use Assertions for Internal Logic:** Assertions are best suited for catching bugs in your code's internal logic, not for handling external input errors (like a user entering the wrong data).  For those, use `try...except` blocks.\n* **Don't Use Assertions for Critical Errors:** Because assertions can be disabled, you should never use them for anything that could cause a security vulnerability or data corruption.\n\n**In summary:** Assertions are a valuable debugging tool that can help you find and fix bugs in your code early in the development process. They are not a replacement for proper error handling in production code.  Use them to validate assumptions about your code's internal state.","metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"from_bard":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
