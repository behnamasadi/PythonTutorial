    "### Properties: Controlled Attribute Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you want more control over how attributes are accessed and modified.  Directly accessing and modifying attributes can lead to issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Validation:** You might want to ensure that the age is always a positive number.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** You might want to hide the internal representation of an attribute and provide a controlled interface.\n",
    "* **Calculated Values:** You might want an attribute to be dynamically calculated based on other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties provide a way to achieve this. They look like regular attributes from the outside but have getter, setter, and deleter methods behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the `property()` Function (Less Common)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `property()` function is one way to create properties, but the decorator approach (explained below) is generally preferred.  Here's what it looks like:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",

    "### Class magic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you define a class, several special attributes (often referred to as **dunder** or **magic** methods/variables because of their double underscores) are automatically provided by Python, even if you don't explicitly define them.  These attributes are crucial for the class's behavior and interaction with the Python runtime.  Here are some of the most important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `__class__`:  This attribute refers to the class itself.  It's useful for introspectionâ€”examining the properties of an object at runtime.\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "*   `__dict__`: This attribute is a dictionary that holds the instance's namespace.  It stores the instance variables (attributes) specific to that object.  Modifying `__dict__` directly can be used (though it's generally discouraged in favor of standard attribute access), but more commonly, it's used for introspection to see what attributes an object has.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "            self.x = x\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `__module__`:  This attribute stores the name of the module where the class is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # In a file named my_module.py:\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",

    "    ```python\n",

While you *can* define these yourself to customize behavior, Python provides default implementations if you don't.\n",
