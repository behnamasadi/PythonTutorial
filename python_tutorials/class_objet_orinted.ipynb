    "* **Data Validation:** You might want to ensure that the age is always a positive number.\n",

    "### Class magic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you define a class, several special attributes (often referred to as **dunder** or **magic** methods/variables because of their double underscores) are automatically provided by Python, even if you don't explicitly define them.  These attributes are crucial for the class's behavior and interaction with the Python runtime.  Here are some of the most important ones:\n",

Modifying `__dict__` directly can be used (though it's generally discouraged in favor of standard attribute access), but more commonly, it's used for introspection to see what attributes an object has.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",

    "\n",
    "Before diving into class and static methods, let's recap instance methods, as they form the foundation.  Instance methods are the most common type of method in a class. They automatically receive the instance of the class (the object) as the first argument, conventionally named `self`.  You use them to work with data *specific to that instance*.\n",
    "\n",

    "class MyClass:\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Class Methods (`@classmethod`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Class methods are bound to the class itself, not an instance of the class. They receive the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named `cls`.  They are used when you need to perform actions that relate to the class as a whole, such as creating instances in different ways or accessing class-level attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How to Define:** You use the `@classmethod` decorator above the method definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_attribute = \"Hello\"\n",

    "    *   **Accessing/Modifying Class Attributes:**  Working with data that is shared across all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Static methods are not automatically passed either the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`).  They are essentially regular functions that are part of the class's namespace.  They are used when a method is logically related to the class but doesn't need to access any instance-specific or class-specific data.\n",

    "result = MyClass.add_numbers(7, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
