    "**1. `if` Statements (Conditional Execution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.  You can also include `elif` (else if) and `else` blocks for more complex decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")  # This will execute\n",
    "\n",
    "if x < 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 5\")  # This will NOT execute\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "elif x == 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is equal to 5\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than 5\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nested if statements are also possible\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "    if x < 15:\n",
    "        print(\"and x is less than 15\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Condition:** The condition is a boolean expression (evaluates to `True` or `False`).\n",
    "*   **Indentation:** Python uses indentation (usually four spaces) to define the code block associated with the `if`, `elif`, or `else`.  Incorrect indentation will lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `for` Loops (Iteration)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or the result of `range()`) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):  # Iterates from 0 to 4\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(2, 7, 2):  # Start at 2, stop before 7, increment by 2\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can also iterate with index using enumerate:\n",
    "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "    print(f\"Fruit at index {index}: {fruit}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Iterable:** The `for` loop works with any iterable object.\n",
    "*   **Loop Variable:** The loop variable (e.g., `fruit` or `i`) takes on the value of each item in the sequence during each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `while` Loops (Repeated Execution While a Condition is True)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true.  Be careful with `while` loops, as they can lead to infinite loops if the condition never becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1  # Important: This updates the count, preventing an infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can use break to exit a while loop prematurely\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while True: # This would be an infinite loop without the break\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "    if count >= 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can use continue to skip the rest of the current iteration\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 10:\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "    if count % 2 == 0: # If count is even\n",
    "        continue # Skip to the next iteration\n",
    "    print(count) # Only odd numbers will be printed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Condition:**  Like the `if` statement, the `while` loop's condition is a boolean expression.\n",
    "*   **Loop Body:** The code within the `while` loop's block is executed repeatedly.\n",
    "*   **Update:** It's crucial to have a way to update the variables involved in the condition, eventually making it false to terminate the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `match-case` (Structural Pattern Matching - Python 3.10+)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `match-case` statement provides a way to perform structural pattern matching.  It's like a more powerful version of a switch statement (though it's not exactly the same as switch statements in other languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "status = 200\n",
    "\n",
    "match status:\n",
    "    case 200:\n",
    "        print(\"OK\")\n",
    "    case 404:\n",
    "        print(\"Not Found\")\n",
    "    case 500:\n",
    "        print(\"Internal Server Error\")\n",
    "    case _:  # Default case (like 'else')\n",
    "        print(\"Unknown Status Code\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# More complex matching with data structures:\n",
    "point = (1, 2)\n",
    "match point:\n",
    "    case (0, 0):\n",
    "        print(\"Origin\")\n",
    "    case (x, 0):\n",
    "        print(f\"x = {x}, y = 0\")\n",
    "    case (0, y):\n",
    "        print(f\"x = 0, y = {y}\")\n",
    "    case (x, y):\n",
    "        print(f\"x = {x}, y = {y}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Matching with classes\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "p = Point(3,4)\n",
    "\n",
    "match p:\n",
    "    case Point(x=0, y=0):\n",
    "        print(\"Origin\")\n",
    "    case Point(x=x, y=0):\n",
    "        print(f\"x = {x}, y = 0\")\n",
    "    case Point(x=0, y=y):\n",
    "        print(f\"x = 0, y = {y}\")\n",
    "    case Point(x=x, y=y):\n",
    "        print(f\"x = {x}, y = {y}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Subject:** The value you're comparing against the patterns (e.g., `status` or `point`).\n",
    "*   **Patterns:** The `case` clauses define patterns to match against the subject.  These can be literal values, sequences, or more complex structures.\n",
    "*   **Guards:** You can add `if` clauses (guards) to cases to further refine the matching conditions.\n",
    "*   `_`: The underscore `_` acts as a wildcard or default case, matching anything that doesn't match the other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These control flow structures are fundamental to programming in Python.  Understanding how to use them effectively is essential for writing clear, concise, and powerful code.  Practice using them in different scenarios to solidify your understanding.\n"
