    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block:**  This block contains the code that you suspect might raise an exception.  The Python interpreter will attempt to execute this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`except` Blocks:**  These blocks define how to handle specific exceptions.  You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of errors.\n",
    "   - **Specific Exception Handling:**  `except ZeroDivisionError:` catches only `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions.  This is best practice - catch specific exceptions when you can.\n",
    "   - **General Exception Handling:** `except Exception as e:` catches *any* type of exception.  The `as e` part assigns the exception object to the variable `e`, allowing you to access details about the error (e.g., the error message).  Use this as a last resort or for logging, as it's often better to handle specific exceptions.\n",
    "   - **Order Matters:** The `except` blocks are checked in order.  The first matching `except` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`finally` Block:**  This block contains code that *always* executes, whether an exception was raised or not.  It's typically used for cleanup tasks, like closing files, releasing resources, or ensuring that certain actions are always performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No Exception:** If the code in the `try` block executes without raising an exception, the `except` blocks are skipped, and the `finally` block is executed.  The program then continues normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exception Raised:** If an exception occurs within the `try` block:\n",
    "    1. Python looks for a matching `except` block.\n",
    "    2. If a match is found, the code in that `except` block is executed.\n",
    "    3. If no matching `except` block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack (potentially causing the program to terminate if not handled elsewhere).\n",
    "    4. The `finally` block is *always* executed after the `try` and the matching `except` block (or after the `try` if no exception occurred).\n",

    "In this example, the `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, even if a `FileNotFoundError` or another exception occurs during file reading.  This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.\n",

    "**Key Advantages of Exception Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robustness:**  Prevents your program from crashing due to unexpected errors.\n",
    "* **Clarity:** Separates error-handling logic from the main code flow, making the code easier to read and understand.\n",
    "* **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to modify and extend the error-handling behavior of your code.\n",
    "* **Resource Management:** Ensures that resources (like files) are properly cleaned up.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering `try`, `except`, and `finally`, you'll significantly improve the quality and reliability of your Python programs. Remember to catch specific exceptions whenever possible and use the general `Exception` sparingly."

    "Exceptions are a crucial part of error handling and robust code.  They allow you to gracefully manage unexpected situations during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Raise Exceptions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Signal Errors:**  When something goes wrong in your code (e.g., invalid input, file not found, network issue), raising an exception signals that the normal flow of execution cannot continue.\n",
    "* **Centralized Error Handling:**  Exceptions allow you to handle errors in a dedicated section of your code, rather than scattering error checks throughout.  This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n",
    "* **Control Flow:**  Raising an exception interrupts the current execution path and searches for an appropriate `except` block to handle it.  This allows you to control how your program responds to different errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Raise Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "You raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword followed by an exception class or an exception instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ExceptionClassName(\"Descriptive error message\")  # Creating an instance\n",
    "raise ExceptionClassName  # Raising the class itself (less common)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Built-in Exception Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides many built-in exception classes for common error scenarios.  Some important ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TypeError`: Raised when an operation is performed on an object of an inappropriate type.\n",
    "* `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "* `NameError`: Raised when a variable or name is not found.\n",
    "* `IndexError`: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range.\n",
    "* `KeyError`: Raised when trying to access a dictionary key that does not exist.\n",
    "* `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when a file or directory is not found.\n",
    "* `IOError`: Raised for input/output related errors.\n",
    "* `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when dividing by zero.\n",
    "* `AssertionError`: Raised when an `assert` statement fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Raising a `ValueError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    if y == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")  # Raise a ValueError\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(result)  # This will not be executed\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)  # Handle the ValueError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e: # Catching a different exception\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This code always runs\") # Cleanup or logging\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Program continues...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Cannot divide by zero\n",
    "This code always runs\n",
    "Program continues...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `divide` function checks if `y` is zero. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n",
    "2. The `try` block attempts to call `divide(10, 0)`.\n",
    "3. Because a `ValueError` is raised, the execution jumps to the corresponding `except ValueError` block.\n",
    "4. The error message is printed.\n",
    "5. The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "6. The program continues execution after the `try...except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own custom exception classes by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.  This is useful for defining specific error conditions in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass  # You can add custom attributes or methods here if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "def process_data(data):\n",
    "    if not isinstance(data, list):\n",
    "        raise InvalidInputError(\"Data must be a list\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    process_data(\"hello\")\n",
    "except InvalidInputError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Data must be a list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use descriptive error messages to help with debugging.\n",
    "* Choose the appropriate exception class for the error condition.\n",
    "* Use `try...except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "* Consider creating custom exceptions for specific error scenarios in your application.\n",
    "* The `finally` block is useful for cleanup operations (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).\n",
