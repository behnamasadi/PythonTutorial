The Python interpreter will attempt to execute this code.\n\n2. **`except` Blocks:**  These blocks define how to handle specific exceptions.  You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of errors.\n   - **Specific Exception Handling:**  `except ZeroDivisionError:` catches only `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions.  This is best practice - catch specific exceptions when you can.\n   - **General Exception Handling:** `except Exception as e:` catches *any* type of exception.  The `as e` part assigns the exception object to the variable `e`, allowing you to access details about the error (e.g., the error message).  Use this as a last resort or for logging, as it's often better to handle specific exceptions.\n   - **Order Matters:** The `except` blocks are checked in order.  The first matching `except` block is executed.\n\n3. **`finally` Block:**  This block contains code that *always* executes, whether an exception was raised or not.  It's typically used for cleanup tasks, like closing files, releasing resources, or ensuring that certain actions are always performed.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n* **No Exception:** If the code in the `try` block executes without raising an exception, the `except` blocks are skipped, and the `finally` block is executed.  The program then continues normally.\n\n* **Exception Raised:** If an exception occurs within the `try` block:\n    1. Python looks for a matching `except` block.\n    2. If a match is found, the code in that `except` block is executed.\n    3. If no matching `except` block is found, the exception propagates up the call stack (potentially causing the program to terminate if not handled elsewhere).\n    4. The `finally` block is *always* executed after the `try` and the matching `except` block (or after the `try` if no exception occurred).\n\n**Example: File Handling**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    file = open(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\")\n    contents = file.read()\n    print(contents)\n    # ... process the file contents ...\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Error: File not found.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred while reading the file: {e}\")\nfinally:\n    if 'file' in locals() and file: # Check if the file was opened\n        file.close()  # Ensure the file is closed, even if an error occurred\n        print(\"File closed.\")\n\nprint(\"File processing complete (or attempted).\")","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this example, the `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, even if a `FileNotFoundError` or another exception occurs during file reading.  This is crucial for preventing resource leaks.\n\n**Key Advantages of Exception Handling:**\n\n* **Robustness:**  Prevents your program from crashing due to unexpected errors.\n* **Clarity:** Separates error-handling logic from the main code flow, making the code easier to read and understand.\n* **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to modify and extend the error-handling behavior of your code.\n* **Resource Management:** Ensures that resources (like files) are properly cleaned up.\n\nBy mastering `try`, `except`, and `finally`, you'll significantly improve the quality and reliability of your Python programs. Remember to catch specific exceptions whenever possible and use the general `Exception` sparingly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"md-recitation\">\n  Sources\n  <ol>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/YashwantDesai/Python_Advanced_Assignment_8\">https://github.com/YashwantDesai/Python_Advanced_Assignment_8</a></li>\n  </ol>\n</div>","metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"from_bard":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
