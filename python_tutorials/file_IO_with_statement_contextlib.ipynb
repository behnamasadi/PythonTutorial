    "\n",
    "*   **`__enter__()`:** The `__enter__()` method of the context manager is called when you enter the `with` block.  For files, this is where the file is opened.  The `__enter__()` method typically returns the resource itself (the file object in this case), which is then assigned to the variable after `as` (e.g., `file` in the example above).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`:** The `__exit__()` method is *always* called when you exit the `with` block, regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Its job is to clean up resources. For files, this is where the `close()` method is called.  The `exc_type`, `exc_val`, and `exc_tb` arguments provide information about any exceptions that were raised. If no exception occurred, they are all `None`.\n",
