    "## here-document (heredoc)\n",
    "\n",
    "`python - <<'EOF'` is a shell construct, not a Python feature.\n",
    "You’re looking at **a here-document (heredoc)** being passed as **stdin to the Python interpreter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what each part means:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `python -`\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyphen tells Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Read the script from standard input instead of from a file.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So whatever comes from stdin will be treated as Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `<<'EOF'`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **bash heredoc**. It says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Take all the following lines, until the line `EOF`, and feed them as stdin.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quotes `'EOF'` mean:\n",
    "No variable expansion, no command substitution — treat the content literally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it together\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python - <<'EOF'\n",
    "print(\"Hello from heredoc!\")\n",
    "x = 2 + 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bash collects everything between `<<'EOF'` and the ending `EOF`.\n",
    "2. Bash sends that text into the stdin of `python -`.\n",
    "3. Python executes that text as if it was a `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use this?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want to run a quick inline script without creating a `.py` file.\n",
    "* You want to embed Python inside a bash script.\n",
    "* You want to generate/pipe dynamic Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example inside a bash script\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "name=\"Behnam\"\n",
    "\n",
    "python - <<'EOF'\n",
    "print(\"This is Python running inside bash\")\n",
    "# Note: name from bash is NOT available here because EOF is quoted\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remove the quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python - <<EOF\n",
    "print(\"Hello, $name\")\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then `$name` will be expanded by bash before sending to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* `python -` means: read Python code from stdin.\n",
    "* `<<'EOF'` starts a heredoc: a block of raw text until the final `EOF`.\n",
    "* Combined: allows inline Python code inside bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can show examples with variable expansion, unquoted heredocs, or creating functions dynamically.\n"
