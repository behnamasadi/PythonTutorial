    "\n",
    "**Why use logging?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Granular Control:** You can categorize log messages by severity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and control which levels are displayed or stored.\n",
    "* **Flexibility:**  Log messages can be sent to different destinations (console, files, network sockets, etc.).\n",
    "* **Maintainability:**  Logging makes it much easier to diagnose issues in production or complex applications.  You can leave logging code in place without affecting performance (by adjusting the logging level).\n",
    "* **Structured Data:** You can format log messages in a consistent way, making them easier to parse and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging (do this once, typically at the start of your program)\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,  # Set the minimum level to log\n",
    "                    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') # Format of log messages\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger (good practice to use a logger per module)\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # __name__ gets the current module's name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now use the logger:\n",
    "logger.debug('This is a debug message (will not be shown by default)')\n",
    "logger.info('This is an info message')\n",
    "logger.warning('This is a warning message')\n",
    "logger.error('This is an error message')\n",
    "logger.critical('This is a critical message')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of logging an exception:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    logger.exception(\"An error occurred\")  # Logs the exception traceback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`logging.basicConfig()`:** This sets up the basic logging configuration.  You usually call this *once* at the start of your application.\n",
    "    * `level`:  The minimum log level to capture.  Messages below this level are ignored.  Common levels (in increasing order of severity):\n",
    "        * `DEBUG`: Detailed information, useful for debugging.\n",
    "        * `INFO`: General information about program execution.\n",
    "        * `WARNING`: Indicates a potential problem.\n",
    "        * `ERROR`: A serious error.\n",
    "        * `CRITICAL`: A very serious error that might cause the program to crash.\n",
    "    * `format`:  A string that defines the layout of log messages.  It can include placeholders like:\n",
    "        * `%(asctime)s`: The time the log message was created.\n",
    "        * `%(name)s`: The name of the logger.\n",
    "        * `%(levelname)s`: The log level (DEBUG, INFO, etc.).\n",
    "        * `%(message)s`: The actual log message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`logging.getLogger(__name__)`:**  Gets a logger instance.  Using `__name__` is a best practice; it creates a logger specific to the current module.  This makes it easier to track down the source of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`logger.debug()`, `logger.info()`, etc.:** These methods are used to log messages at different levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`logger.exception()`:**  Logs an exception and its traceback.  This is very helpful for debugging errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Logging:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handlers:** Handlers determine *where* log messages go.  You can have multiple handlers for a single logger (e.g., one for the console, one for a file).  Common handlers include:\n",
    "    * `StreamHandler`: Sends log messages to a stream (like the console).\n",
    "    * `FileHandler`: Writes log messages to a file.\n",
    "    * `RotatingFileHandler`:  Rotates log files when they get too large.\n",
    "* **Formatters:** Formatters control the *appearance* of log messages.  You can create custom formatters to tailor the output to your needs.\n",
    "* **Loggers Hierarchy:** Loggers are organized in a hierarchy.  This allows you to control logging behavior at different levels of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with File Handling and Custom Formatting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a formatter\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(module)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a file handler\n",
    "file_handler = logging.FileHandler('my_log_file.log')\n",
    "file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger and add the handler\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n",
    "logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Log everything from DEBUG and above\n",
    "\n",
    "logger.debug('This is a debug message going to the file.')\n",
    "logger.info('This is an info message also in the file.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to send log messages to a file and how to use a custom formatter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Improvements over `print()`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Level-based logging:** Control which messages are displayed.\n",
    "* **Multiple destinations:** Send logs to different places.\n",
    "* **Formatting:** Create structured, easy-to-parse logs.\n",
    "* **Maintainability:**  Keep logging code in production without performance impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module is an essential tool for any serious Python developer.  It provides a robust and flexible way to manage logging in your applications.  This explanation should give you a good starting point.  For more advanced features, refer to the official Python documentation.\n"
