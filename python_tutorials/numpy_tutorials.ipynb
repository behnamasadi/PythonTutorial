    "### missing second dimension\n",
    "\n",
    " when we refer to an array missing a second dimension, we're generally talking about a one-dimensional array, often known as a 1D array or a vector. In other words, this is an array that has only one axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what it means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape**: If you query the shape of a 1D array, you'll get something like `(n,)` where `n` is the number of elements. The missing second dimension is evident by the single comma. For a 2D array, the shape would look like `(m, n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing Elements**: For a 1D array, you only need one index to access its elements: `array[i]`. In contrast, for a 2D array, you'd use two indices: `array[i, j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**: You can think of a 1D array as a simple list or a linear set of items. A 2D array can be visualized as a grid or a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a 1D array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "array = np.arange(3)\n",
    "print(array.shape)\n",
    "print(array.tolist())\n",
    "print(array.reshape(3,1).tolist())\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "```\n",
    "(3,)\n",
    "[0, 1, 2]\n",
    "[[0], [1], [2]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's worth noting that a 1D array is different from a 2D row or column vector. A column vector has a shape like `(n, 1)`, while a row vector has a shape like `(1, n)`. However, a 1D array's shape will just be `(n,)`.\n",

    "### np.vectorize\n",
    " `np.vectorize` is a class that converts an ordinary Python function, which accepts scalars and returns scalars, into a \"vectorized\" function that can operate on (and return) entire arrays. It provides a way to apply the function element-wise on input arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's worth noting that `np.vectorize` doesn't make your code inherently faster. Under the hood, it essentially uses a loop to apply the given function to each element in the input arrays. The primary purpose of `np.vectorize` is to transform a scalar function into one that can operate on and return arrays, making the code cleaner and more in line with NumPy's broadcasting semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def scalar_function(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "vectorized_function = np.vectorize(scalar_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the vectorized function on an array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(vectorized_function(arr))\n",
    "# Output: [ 1  4  9 16 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Multiple Input Arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorized function can also handle multiple input arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def scalar_add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "vectorized_add = np.vectorize(scalar_add)\n",
    "\n",
    "arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(vectorized_add(arr1, arr2))\n",
    "# Output: [5 7 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Transformation**: As mentioned, the primary purpose is to convert a scalar function into one that works with arrays.\n",
    "2. **Readability**: It can make the code cleaner when working with NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Not to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: If you're looking for performance gains, it's usually better to use native NumPy functions or operations that inherently support array computations, as they are implemented in optimized C or Fortran code.\n",
    "2. **Complex Operations**: For more complicated operations where performance is critical, consider using NumPy's built-in functions or other optimized tools such as `numba` or Cython.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, `np.vectorize` is a convenience function, but if performance is a concern, it's essential to be aware of its loop-like nature under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword in Python. They can be used in tandem with functions like `np.apply_along_axis()` to apply operations element-wise or along a specified axis of a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of examples demonstrating the use of lambda functions with NumPy arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Applying a Lambda Function Element-wise to a 1D Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a simple 1D array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use lambda to square each element\n",
    "squared = np.vectorize(lambda x: x**2)(arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [ 1  4  9 16 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use `np.vectorize()` to vectorize the lambda function, allowing it to operate on each element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Applying a Lambda Function Along an Axis of a 2D Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a 2D array\n",
    "arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "                   [4, 5, 6],\n",
    "                   [7, 8, 9]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use lambda to compute the sum of each row\n",
    "row_sum = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: np.sum(x), axis=1, arr=arr_2d)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(row_sum)  # Output: [ 6 15 24]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `np.apply_along_axis()` applies the lambda function (which computes the sum) along `axis=1`, thus computing the sum for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, while lambda functions offer a concise way to define simple functions, they might make the code less readable if the operations are complex. In such cases, it might be better to define a standalone function instead of using lambda.\n",
    "\n",

    "### numpy.where()\n",
    "`numpy.where()` and its lambda equivalents: `numpy.where()` is a powerful function in NumPy that allows you to conditionally select elements from arrays. It's like a vectorized \"if-else\" statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Usage and Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "condition = np.array([True, False, True, False])\n",
    "x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "y = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])\n",
    "\n",
    "result = np.where(condition, x, y)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [ 1 20  3 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `condition`: A boolean array.  Elements where the condition is `True` will be taken from `x`.\n",
    "*   `x`: The array from which elements are taken if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "*   `y`: The array from which elements are taken if the condition is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output `result` is a new array where each element is chosen based on the corresponding value in the `condition` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lambda Equivalents**\n",
    "\n",
    "While `numpy.where()` is highly optimized, you can achieve similar (though often less efficient) results using Python's `lambda` functions and list comprehensions or `zip`.  However, these methods don't provide the same performance benefits as `numpy.where()`, especially for large arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. List Comprehension with `zip`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result_lambda = np.array([x_val if cond else y_val for cond, x_val, y_val in zip(condition, x, y)])\n",
    "print(result_lambda) # Output: [ 1 20  3 40] (same result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most direct equivalent using a list comprehension.  `zip` combines the three arrays element-wise, and the `if/else` within the list comprehension selects the correct value.  We then convert the list to a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.  `lambda` with `zip` (Less Common and Less Efficient):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "selector = lambda cond, x_val, y_val: x_val if cond else y_val\n",
    "result_lambda_lambda = np.array([selector(cond, x_val, y_val) for cond, x_val, y_val in zip(condition, x, y)])\n",
    "print(result_lambda_lambda) # Output: [ 1 20  3 40] (same result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces a `lambda` function, but it doesn't really add anything and is generally less readable than the list comprehension approach.  It's still iterating element-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Nested `np.where` for More Complex Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "condition1 = np.array([True, False, True, False])\n",
    "condition2 = np.array([False, True, True, False])\n",
    "\n",
    "result_nested = np.where(condition1, np.where(condition2, 5, 6), np.where(condition2, 7, 8))\n",
    "print(result_nested) # Output: [6 7 5 8]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Equivalent lambda (much less readable and efficient):\n",
    "result_nested_lambda = np.array([\n",
    "    5 if cond1 and cond2 else 6 if cond1 else 7 if cond2 else 8\n",
    "    for cond1, cond2 in zip(condition1, condition2)\n",
    "])\n",
    "print(result_nested_lambda) # Output: [6 7 5 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested `np.where()` calls allow for more complex logic. The lambda equivalent rapidly becomes hard to read and maintain.  This is a strong case for using `np.where()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences and Why `numpy.where()` is Preferred:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Performance:** `numpy.where()` is significantly faster, especially for larger arrays. It's implemented in C and optimized for vectorized operations. The lambda/list comprehension approaches involve Python loops, which are much slower.\n",
    "*   **Readability:**  While simple `if/else` conditions can be expressed reasonably well with list comprehensions, `numpy.where()` becomes much clearer for complex nested conditions.\n",
    "*   **Conciseness:** `numpy.where()` is often more concise, especially for complex conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Lambda/List Comprehension:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might consider lambda/list comprehension for very small arrays or when the logic is extremely simple and readability is paramount.  However, for any serious numerical work with NumPy, `numpy.where()` is almost always the right choice.  It's more efficient, readable, and idiomatic NumPy."

    "## Applying a lambda function to NumPy array \n",
    "You can apply a lambda function to NumPy array elements in several ways, each with its own performance characteristics and use cases. Here's a breakdown of the common methods and when to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using `numpy.vectorize()` (Generally Avoid):**\n",
    "\n",
    "While `np.vectorize()` *appears* to be a concise way to apply a function element-wise, it's often the *slowest* option.  It's essentially a Python loop under the hood, negating the benefits of NumPy's vectorized operations.  Avoid it for performance-sensitive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example using vectorize (generally avoid)\n",
    "vfunc = np.vectorize(lambda x: x * 2)\n",
    "result = vfunc(arr)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [ 2  4  6  8 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or directly (still slow)\n",
    "result = np.vectorize(lambda x: x * 2)(arr)\n",
    "print(result) # Output: [ 2  4  6  8 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Vectorized Operations (The Preferred Way):**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy excels at vectorized operations.  If your lambda function can be expressed using NumPy's built-in functions and operators, this is the *fastest* and most efficient approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example using vectorized operation (fastest)\n",
    "result = arr * 2  # Equivalent to lambda x: x * 2\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [ 2  4  6  8 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "# More complex example:\n",
    "result = np.where(arr > 2, arr * 2, arr / 2) # Equivalent to a lambda with a conditional\n",
    "print(result) # Output: [0.5 1.  3.  4.  5. ]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another Example:\n",
    "result = np.sin(arr) # Applying a trigonometric function.\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. List Comprehension (Intermediate Speed):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your lambda function is too complex to be directly vectorized but you still want some performance improvement over `np.vectorize()`, you can use list comprehension and then convert back to a NumPy array. This is often faster than `np.vectorize()` but slower than direct vectorized operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example using list comprehension (intermediate speed)\n",
    "result = np.array([lambda x: x * 2 for x in arr]) # Incorrect: This creates an array of functions!\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = np.array([x * 2 for x in arr]) # Correct: This applies the function and creates the array.\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [ 2  4  6  8 10]\n",

    "print(result) # Output: [0.5 1.  3.  4.  5. ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `numpy.apply_along_axis()` (For Specific Cases):**\n",
    "\n",
    "`apply_along_axis()` is useful when you need to apply a function to 1D slices of a multi-dimensional array.  It's not as efficient as direct vectorized operations but can be helpful for certain types of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example using apply_along_axis (for multi-dimensional arrays)\n",
    "result = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: x * 2, axis=0, arr=arr)  # Apply along columns (axis=0)\n",
    "print(result)\n",

    "print(result)\n",
    "# [[ 2  4  6]\n",
    "#  [ 8 10 12]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prioritize Vectorization:**  Always try to express your operations using NumPy's built-in functions and operators. This is the most efficient approach.\n",
    "* **Avoid `np.vectorize()`:**  It's often slow and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.\n",
    "* **Consider List Comprehension:**  If vectorization isn't possible, list comprehension can be a faster alternative to `np.vectorize()`.\n",
    "* **Use `apply_along_axis()` Sparingly:**  Only when you need to apply a function to 1D slices of a multi-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these guidelines, you can write efficient NumPy code that takes advantage of its powerful vectorized operations. Remember to profile your code if performance is critical to ensure you are using the most effective method.\n"

    "You're very close! The issue lies in how you're using `n.any()`.  `n.any()` checks the truthiness of the *elements of the array itself*, not the result of a comparison.  You need to apply the comparison *first*, and then use `any()` on the *resulting boolean array*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the corrected code and explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "print(n > 5)  # Print the boolean array resulting from the comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "print((n > 5).any())  # Correct way: Apply .any() to the boolean array\n",
    "print((n > 5).all()) # Correct way to check if all are true\n",
    "\n",
    "print(n.any()) # This checks if any of the *original* numbers are non-zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`n > 5`:** This creates a *new* array of the same shape as `n`, but containing boolean values (`True` or `False`).  Each element in the new array is `True` if the corresponding element in `n` is greater than 5, and `False` otherwise.  This is the boolean array you want to operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`(n > 5).any()`:**  This applies the `any()` method to the *boolean array* created in the previous step. It correctly checks if *at least one* element in the *boolean array* is `True` (meaning at least one element in `n` was greater than 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`n.any()` (Incorrect):** This applies `any()` to the original array `n`.  NumPy treats any non-zero number as `True` in a boolean context. So, `n.any()` returns `True` if `n` contains any non-zero number.  This is *not* what you intended; you wanted to check if any number was greater than 5, not just if it was non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`(n > 5).all()`:** This checks if all the elements in the boolean array are `True`, meaning all elements in `n` are greater than 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** Always perform the comparison (e.g., `n > 5`) *first* to create a boolean array, and then apply `any()` or `all()` to that boolean array to get the desired result.\n"
