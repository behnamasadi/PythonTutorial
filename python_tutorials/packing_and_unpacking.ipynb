    "**1. Packing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Packing gathers multiple values into a single data structure, usually a tuple.  It happens implicitly in several situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuple Creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1, 2, 3  # Packing into a tuple\n",
    "print(my_tuple)      # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(type(my_tuple)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function Return Values:**  A function can implicitly pack multiple return values into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_coordinates():\n",
    "    return 10, 20  # Returns a tuple (packing)\n",
    "\n",
    "x, y = get_coordinates() # Unpacking the returned tuple\n",
    "print(x, y) # Output: 10 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assignment:** You can pack values on the right-hand side of an assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, c = 1, \"hello\", 3.14  # Packing on the right, unpacking on the left\n",
    "print(a,b,c) # Output: 1 hello 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1,2,3]\n",
    "a,*rest = my_list # a = 1, rest = [2,3]\n",
    "print(a,rest) # Output: 1 [2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Unpacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpacking extracts values from a packed data structure (usually a tuple or list) and assigns them to individual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direct Assignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coordinates = (10, 20)\n",
    "x, y = coordinates  # Unpacking the tuple\n",
    "print(x, y)      # Output: 10 20\n",
    "\n",
    "point = [5,6]\n",
    "x,y = point # Unpacking the list\n",
    "print(x,y) # Output: 5 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function Arguments:**  You can use `*` (for positional arguments) or `**` (for keyword arguments) to unpack iterables into function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, age):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "person = (\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "greet(*person)  # Unpacking the tuple into positional arguments. Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "details = {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "greet(**details)  # Unpacking the dictionary into keyword arguments. Output: Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterating through Tuples/Lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]\n",
    "for x, y in points:  # Unpacking within the loop\n",
    "    print(f\"x: {x}, y: {y}\")\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# x: 1, y: 2\n",
    "# x: 3, y: 4\n",
    "# x: 5, y: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Extended Unpacking (Python 3+)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `*` to unpack part of an iterable and assign the rest to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "first, *rest, last = numbers\n",
    "print(first)  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(rest)   # Output: [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "print(last)   # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "head, *tail = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "print(head) # Output: 1\n",
    "print(tail) # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences and Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Packing:** Useful for grouping data together, returning multiple values from a function, and creating tuples efficiently.\n",
    "* **Unpacking:** Essential for assigning values from iterables to individual variables, passing arguments to functions dynamically, and iterating through structured data.\n",
    "* **Extended Unpacking:**  Provides flexibility when you want to work with parts of a sequence while keeping the remainder in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Swapping Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Packing and unpacking make variable swapping very concise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "a, b = b, a  # Packing and unpacking in one line!\n",
    "print(a, b)  # Output: 20 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of variables on the left-hand side of an unpacking assignment must match the number of elements in the iterable being unpacked (unless you use `*` for extended unpacking). Otherwise, you'll get a `ValueError`.\n",
    "* Packing always creates a tuple, even if there's only one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding packing and unpacking is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic code.  They are frequently used in various programming scenarios.  Let me know if you have any more specific questions!\n"
