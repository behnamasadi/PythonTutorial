    "## Python slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python slicing is a powerful way to extract portions of sequences like strings, lists, tuples, and other iterable objects. It allows you to grab elements based on their indices, creating a new sequence (a shallow copy) without modifying the original.  Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sequence[start:stop:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`start`:**  The starting index (inclusive). If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the sequence).\n",
    "* **`stop`:** The ending index (exclusive).  The element at this index is *not* included in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the sequence (the end).\n",
    "* **`step`:** The increment between indices. If omitted, it defaults to 1 (every element).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a sample list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic slicing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_list[2:5])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This extracts elements from index 2 up to (but not including) index 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Omitting `start`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_list[:5])   # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Starts from the beginning of the list up to (but not including) index 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Omitting `stop`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_list[5:])   # Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Starts from index 5 to the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Omitting both `start` and `stop`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_list[:])   # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Creates a shallow copy of the entire list.  This is a common way to duplicate a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using `step`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_list[1:8:2])  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Starts at index 1, goes up to (but not including) index 8, taking every second element.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Negative indexing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(my_list[-1])    # Output: 9 (the last element)\n",
    "   print(my_list[-3:])   # Output: [7, 8, 9] (last three elements)\n",
    "   print(my_list[:-2])  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (up to the last two)\n",
    "   print(my_list[::-1])  # Output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] (reverses the list)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Negative indices count from the end of the sequence. -1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing Strings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing works identically with strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_string[7:])    # Output: World!\n",
    "print(my_string[:5])    # Output: Hello\n",
    "print(my_string[7:12])   # Output: World\n",
    "print(my_string[::2])   # Output: Hlo ol! (every other character)\n",
    "print(my_string[::-1]) # Output: !dlroW ,olleH (reverse the string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shallow Copy:** Slicing creates a *new* object, but it's a *shallow* copy.  This means that if the original sequence contains mutable objects (like lists within a list), the inner objects are *not* copied. Changes to those inner objects will be reflected in both the original and the slice.\n",
    "* **Out-of-Bounds Indices:** Python handles out-of-bounds indices gracefully.  If your `stop` index is beyond the end of the sequence, it's treated as the end.  If your `start` index is beyond the end, you'll get an empty sequence.\n",
    "* **Immutability (Strings and Tuples):** Strings and tuples are immutable.  Slicing them creates a new string or tuple; it doesn't modify the original. Lists are mutable, so slicing them creates a new list, but the elements within the new list point to the same objects in the original list (shallow copy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is a fundamental and frequently used technique in Python. Mastering it will make your code more concise and efficient.\n"
