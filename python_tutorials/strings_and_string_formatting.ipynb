{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Strings are a fundamental data type in Python, used to represent text. String formatting allows you to create dynamic strings by embedding variables and expressions within them. Here's a breakdown of strings and string formatting in Python:\n\n**Strings**\n\n* **Creation:** Strings are created using single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`) to enclose a sequence of characters. For example:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"string1 = 'Hello, world!'\n   string2 = \"Python is awesome.\"","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Immutability:** Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. If you need to modify a string, you'll have to create a new one.\n\n* **Operations:** Python provides various built-in functions and operators for working with strings, such as:\n    * Concatenation (`+`): Combines two or more strings.\n    * Slicing (`[]`): Extracts a portion of a string.\n    * Length (`len()`): Returns the number of characters in a string.\n    * Case conversion (`lower()`, `upper()`): Changes the case of a string.\n    * Searching and replacing (`find()`, `replace()`): Locates substrings and replaces them.\n\n**String Formatting**\n\nPython offers several ways to format strings, each with its own advantages:\n\n1. **f-strings (Formatted String Literals)**\n\n   * Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions within strings.\n   * You prefix a string with `f` or `F` and enclose expressions in curly braces `{}`.\n   * Expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"name = \"Alice\"\n   age = 30\n   message = f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\"\n   print(message)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"2. **`str.format()` Method**\n\n   * This method allows you to format strings using placeholders within the string and then passing the values as arguments to the `format()` method.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"name = \"Bob\"\n   score = 95\n   message = \"Hello, {}! Your score is {}.\".format(name, score)\n   print(message)  # Output: Hello, Bob! Your score is 95.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"3. **Old-style String Formatting (using `%`)**\n\n   * This is the oldest method, similar to `printf` formatting in C.\n   * It uses `%` as a placeholder for variables, followed by a conversion specifier (e.g., `%s` for strings, `%d` for integers).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"name = \"Charlie\"\n   height = 1.85\n   message = \"Name: %s, Height: %.2f meters\" % (name, height)\n   print(message)  # Output: Name: Charlie, Height: 1.85 meters","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Choosing a Formatting Method**\n\n* f-strings are generally preferred for their readability and conciseness, especially for simple formatting tasks.\n* The `str.format()` method is useful for more complex scenarios, such as when you need to reuse values or format them in different ways.\n* Old-style formatting is still supported but is less commonly used in modern Python code.\n\n**Additional Formatting Options**\n\n* You can use format specifiers to control the appearance of values within strings, such as:\n    * Precision for floating-point numbers (`:.2f`)\n    * Alignment (`:<10`, `:>10`, `:^10`)\n    * Padding (`:05d`)\n    * Thousands separators (`,`)\n\n* Refer to the Python documentation for a comprehensive list of format specifiers.\n\nRemember that string formatting is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and well-structured text in your Python programs. Choose the method that best suits your needs and coding style.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"md-recitation\">\n  Sources\n  <ol>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/SAMEERA261/Strings-total-note_201023\">https://github.com/SAMEERA261/Strings-total-note_201023</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://jksae.jp/python-%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E5%88%97%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AF%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%82%92%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%86%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8D%E3%81%AB%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8/\">https://jksae.jp/python-%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E5%88%97%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AF%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%82%92%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%86%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8D%E3%81%AB%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8/</a></li>\n  </ol>\n</div>","metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"from_bard":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
