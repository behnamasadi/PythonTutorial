    "\n",
    "**1. Multiplication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common use.  `*` performs standard multiplication between numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = 5 * 3  # result will be 15\n",

    "\n",
    "price = 10.50\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. String Repetition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When used with a string and an integer, `*` repeats the string that many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello\" * 3  # message will be \"HelloHelloHello\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"-\" * 20)  # Prints 20 hyphens\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sequence Unpacking (using *args):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `*` operator can unpack elements from iterables (like lists, tuples, sets) into function arguments. This is particularly useful when you don't know the number of arguments a function expects.  This is commonly used with the `*args` parameter in function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(a, b, c):\n",
    "    print(a, b, c)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Packing into a List (in Python 3):**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3 and later, `*` can also be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to pack remaining elements into a list.\n",

   "source": [
    "In Python, parentheses `()` have several roles, and whether they create a tuple depends on the context. Let's break down the scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parentheses that *do* create tuples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit tuple creation:**  When you use parentheses with commas inside, you are explicitly creating a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  # Creates a tuple: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   another_tuple = (4,)   # Creates a tuple with a single element: (4,)  (Note the trailing comma!)\n",
    "   empty_tuple = ()       # Creates an empty tuple: ()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Packing:** When you assign multiple values to a single variable, Python *packs* those values into a tuple. The parentheses are optional here, but often used for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 1, 2, 3        # x becomes the tuple: (1, 2, 3)  Parentheses are implied\n",
    "   y = (5, 6)       # y becomes the tuple: (5, 6)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning multiple values from a function:**  When a function returns multiple values, they are implicitly packed into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       return 10, 20  # Returns the tuple: (10, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "   result = my_function() \n",
    "   print(type(result)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parentheses that *do not* create tuples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grouping expressions:** Parentheses are used to group expressions to control the order of operations, just like in mathematics.  They *don't* create tuples in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = (2 + 3) * 4   # Parentheses control the order: (5) * 4 = 20\n",
    "   print(type(result))    # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "   result = 2 + (3 * 4)   # Parentheses control the order: 2 + (12) = 14\n",
    "   print(type(result))    # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Even with multiple operations, no tuple is created unless you have commas:\n",
    "   result = (2 + 3, 4 * 5) # Creates a tuple: (5, 20)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function calls:** Parentheses are essential for calling functions. They enclose the arguments passed to the function.  They *don't* create tuples on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Hello\")      # Parentheses are for the function call, not a tuple\n",
    "   value = abs(-5)     # Parentheses are for the function call, not a tuple\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method calls:** Similar to function calls, parentheses are used for calling methods on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "   upper_string = my_string.upper()  # Parentheses are for the method call\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditional expressions (ternary operator):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   y = 20 if x > 5 else 30  # Parentheses are optional but don't create a tuple here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When can you safely use parentheses without creating a tuple?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can safely use parentheses for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grouping expressions:**  To control the order of operations in arithmetic or logical expressions.\n",
    "* **Function and method calls:** To pass arguments to functions and methods.\n",
    "* **Conditional expressions:** In ternary operators.\n",
    "* **Other syntactic constructs:**  Where parentheses are required by the Python syntax, but don't imply tuple creation (e.g., in `if`, `for`, `while` statements, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**  Parentheses *only* create tuples when they enclose comma-separated values (or a single value with a trailing comma). In all other cases, they serve different purposes like grouping, function/method calls, etc.  Pay attention to the presence of commas to distinguish between tuple creation and other uses of parentheses.\n"

    "In Python, `None` is a special constant that represents the absence of a value. It is used to indicate that a variable or expression does not have a valid value or points to nothing. You can use the `is` keyword to check if a variable is referring to the `None` object. Here's an example of how to use `is None`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_if_none(value):\n",
    "    if value is None:\n",
    "        print(\"The value is None.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"The value is: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "value1 = None\n",
    "value2 = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "check_if_none(value1)  # Output: The value is None.\n",
    "check_if_none(value2)  # Output: The value is: 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some scenarios where you might want to use `is None`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default parameter values**: If you have a function that accepts optional arguments and wants to check if a parameter was provided by the caller or if it's missing (None is often used as the default value).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing for existence or validity**: You can use `is None` to check if a variable has been initialized or set to a value. For example, in file handling, you might check if a file object is valid before performing operations on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning values from functions**: Sometimes, functions return None to indicate failure or no useful result. Checking the return value with `is None` can help you handle such cases appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clearing references**: When you want to explicitly release the reference to an object, you can set it to None. This can be helpful in managing memory usage in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that `is None` is different from `== None`. The former checks for identity (whether two objects are the same), while the latter checks for equality (whether two objects have the same value). For None, these two checks will typically give the same result, but it's generally recommended to use `is None` for clarity and to avoid potential pitfalls when dealing with custom classes that might override the equality comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sure! Let's create an example for each case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default parameter values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name=None):\n",
    "    if name is None:\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, stranger!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "greet()          # Output: Hello, stranger!\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")   # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing for existence or validity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_file(file_path):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero.\")  # Output: Error: Division by zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clearing references**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def heavy_computation():\n",
    "    # Some time-consuming computation\n",
    "    result = 42\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "result1 = heavy_computation()\n",
    "print(f\"Result1: {result1}\")  # Output: Result1: 42\n",
    "\n",
    "result1 = None  # Clearing the reference to the result\n",
    "# At this point, the result of heavy_computation() is no longer accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "result2 = heavy_computation()\n",
    "print(f\"Result2: {result2}\")  # Output: Result2: 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last example, by setting `result1` to `None`, we release the reference to the previous result of `heavy_computation()`, allowing the garbage collector to free up the memory if there are no other references to the same object. When we call `heavy_computation()` again and store the result in `result2`, it creates a new object in memory.\n",
