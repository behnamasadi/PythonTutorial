    "# Continuous-time State Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous-time state equations are differential equations that relate the state variables of the system to their derivatives over time. These state equations capture how the state of the system evolves continuously over time in response to inputs, disturbances, and the system's own dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a general form of continuous-time state equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y(t) = g(x(t), u(t), t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x(t) $ is the state vector, a set of variables representing the state of the system at time $t $.\n",
    "- $\\dot{x}(t) $ is the derivative of the state vector with respect to time, representing the rate of change of the state variables.\n",
    "- $u(t) $ is the input vector, representing external inputs to the system at time $t $.\n",
    "- $y(t) $ is the output vector, representing the outputs of the system that can be observed or measured.\n",
    "- $f $ is a vector-valued function that describes how the state of the system evolves over time.\n",
    "- $g $ is a function that describes how the outputs are related to the state and inputs of the system.\n",
    "- $t $ denotes time.\n",

    "### Example: Mass-Spring-Damper System\n",
    "\n",
    "One classic example of continuous-time state equations is the mass-spring-damper system, which can be used to model mechanical systems like vehicle suspension or robotics components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Mass_spring_damper.svg\" alt=\"Mass-Spring-Damper\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! The mass-spring-damper model is a classical linear system model used in engineering to describe a variety of physical systems that exhibit oscillatory behavior. It consists of three components that are idealized:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mass (m):** This represents the object that is moving or being displaced. It has inertia, meaning it resists changes in its motion according to Newton's second law of motion $F = m \\cdot a $, where $F $ is the force applied to the mass, $m $ is the mass itself, and $a $ is the acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spring (k):** This represents an elastic element that stores potential energy. According to Hooke's law, the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from its rest length: $F_{spring} = -k \\cdot x $, where $k $ is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the spring), and $x $ is the displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Damper (b):** Also known as a dashpot, this represents a damping element that dissipates energy from the system, usually as heat. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the mass but acts in the opposite direction: $F_{damping} = -b \\cdot v $, where $b $ is the damping coefficient, and $v $ is the velocity of the mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components form a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes the motion of the mass as it moves under the influence of the spring and damper. The basic equation for this system (assuming no other external forces) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m \\cdot \\ddot{x}(t) + b \\cdot \\dot{x}(t) + k \\cdot x(t) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\ddot{x}(t) $ is the acceleration of the mass (the second derivative of the position with respect to time).\n",
    "- $\\dot{x}(t) $ is the velocity of the mass (the first derivative of the position with respect to time).\n",
    "- $x(t) $ is the position of the mass relative to its equilibrium position.\n",
    "- $t $ represents time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this differential equation will describe how the position of the mass changes over time, including how it oscillates after being displaced from its equilibrium position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior of the Mass-Spring-Damper System\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the system is characterized by one of three scenarios based on the damping ratio $\\zeta $, which is the ratio of the actual damping $b $ to the critical damping $b_c = 2 \\sqrt{mk} $:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Underdamped ($\\zeta < 1 $):** The system will oscillate with the amplitude gradually decreasing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critically damped ($\\zeta = 1 $):** The system will return to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overdamped ($\\zeta > 1 $):** The system will return to equilibrium without oscillating, but more slowly than in the critically damped case.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems are prevalent in mechanical engineering to model vehicle suspensions, electrical engineering to design circuit oscillators, and in control systems for analyzing the dynamic response of systems to various inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a mass-spring-damper system, the equations can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mass ($m $) - the object with mass that can move.\n",
    "2. Spring constant ($k $) - represents the spring's resistance to changes in length.\n",
    "3. Damping coefficient ($b $) - represents the resistance to motion due to damping (like friction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The state variables for such a system could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Position of the mass ($x_1(t) $) - representing the displacement from equilibrium.\n",
    "- Velocity of the mass ($x_2(t) = \\dot{x}_1(t) $) - the rate of change of displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the system ($u(t) $) could be an external force applied to the mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous-time state equations would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{x}_2(t) = \\frac{-b}{m}x_2(t) - \\frac{k}{m}x_1(t) + \\frac{1}{m}u(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\dot{x}_1(t) $ is the velocity (the first derivative of position), and $\\dot{x}_2(t) $ is the acceleration (the second derivative of position or the first derivative of velocity). These equations show how the position and velocity of the mass change over time based on the spring and damping characteristics, as well as any external force applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the system could be simply the position $y(t) = x_1(t) $, or any function of the state and input depending on what part of the system's behavior is of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more concrete example, let's say we have a system where the mass is 1 kg, the spring constant is 10 N/m, and the damping coefficient is 1 Ns/m, and we apply a force of 1 N to the mass. The state equations become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{x}_2(t) = -x_2(t) - 10x_1(t) + u(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "with $u(t) = 1 $ N. This system of differential equations can be solved given initial conditions for $x_1(0) $ and $x_2(0) $, typically using analytical methods for simple systems or numerical methods for more complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The state-space representation of Continuous-time State Equations\n",
    "the state-space representation of a system is a mathematical model that represents a physical system as a set of input, output, and state variables related by first-order differential equations. For the mass-spring-damper system I described above, we can write the state-space representation in matrix form as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the state vector as:\n",
    "$ \\mathbf{x}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "where $x_1(t) $ is the position and $x_2(t) $ is the velocity of the mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input vector $\\mathbf{u}(t) $ is:\n",
    "$ \\mathbf{u}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} F(t) \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "where $F(t) $ is the external force applied to the mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state-space form consists of two equations, the state equation, and the output equation. The state equation can be written as:\n",
    "$ \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = A\\mathbf{x}(t) + B\\mathbf{u}(t) $\n",
    "and the output equation as:\n",
    "$ \\mathbf{y}(t) = C\\mathbf{x}(t) + D\\mathbf{u}(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "For our mass-spring-damper system, the matrices $A, B, C, $ and $D $ would be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m} & -\\frac{b}{m} \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "$ B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{m} \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "$ C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "$ D = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "So the state-space equations become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{x}_1(t) \\\\ \\dot{x}_2(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m} & -\\frac{b}{m} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{m} \\end{bmatrix} F(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\end{bmatrix} F(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of equations fully describes the system's dynamics in state-space form. The state equation describes how the state of the system changes over time, and the output equation describes how the current state (and possibly the input) affects the output of the system. This form is particularly useful for designing controllers and observers for dynamic systems."
