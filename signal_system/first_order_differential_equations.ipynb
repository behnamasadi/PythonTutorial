    "First-order differential equations and linear differential equations are two important classes of differential equations commonly encountered in mathematics and engineering. They have some overlap, but they are not the same. Here's how they differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "### First-Order Differential Equations:\n",
    "A first-order differential equation involves derivatives of the first degree (no higher-order derivatives) with respect to the independent variable. The general form of a first-order differential equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ f(x, y) $ can be any function involving $ x $ and $ y $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Example**: $ \\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x) $, where $ p(x) $ and $ q(x) $ are functions of $ x $ only.\n",
    "- **Non-Linear Example**: $ \\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - x $, where the term $ y^2 $ makes it non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Differential Equations:\n",
    "A linear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable and all its derivatives appear to the first power only (no exponents other than 1) and are not multiplied together. They can be of any order (first, second, etc.). The general form of an $ n $-th order linear differential equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a_n(x)\\frac{d^n y}{dx^n} + a_{n-1}(x)\\frac{d^{n-1} y}{dx^{n-1}} + \\ldots + a_1(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} + a_0(x)y = g(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \\ldots, a_1(x), a_0(x) $ are coefficients which can be functions of $ x $ but not $ y $, and $ g(x) $ is the non-homogeneous term.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First-Order Linear**: When $ n = 1 $, the equation $ a_1(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} + a_0(x)y = g(x) $ is both linear and first-order.\n",
    "- **Higher-Order Linear**: An example would be $ \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} - 3\\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = e^x $, which is linear but not first-order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "- **Order**: First-order refers to the highest derivative being the first derivative. Linear refers to the power of the dependent variable and its derivatives, not the order.\n",
    "- **Linearity**: First-order equations can be either linear or non-linear, while linear equations are always linear, regardless of their order.\n",
    "- **Solutions**: The solution methods for first-order equations depend on whether they are linear or non-linear. Linear differential equations of any order have a well-defined set of solution techniques, often involving the principle of superposition for the homogeneous part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlap:\n",
    "A first-order linear differential equation is both first-order and linear, fitting into both categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Comparisons:\n",
    "- **First-Order Linear**: $ \\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x) $ (Both first-order and linear)\n",
    "- **First-Order Non-Linear**: $ \\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 + x $ (First-order but not linear)\n",
    "- **Second-Order Linear**: $ \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x)\\frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y = r(x) $ (Linear but not first-order)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between these types of differential equations is crucial for choosing the correct methods to find their solutions."
