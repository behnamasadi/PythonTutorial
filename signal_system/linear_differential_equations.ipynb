    "Linear differential equations are a type of differential equation where the **unknown function** and its **derivatives** appear to the power of **1**. They are characterized by having no products or compositions of the unknown function and its derivatives. Here's an example along with a brief description:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the linear differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a(x) y'' + b(x) y' + c(x) y = g(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ y'' $ denotes the second derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ x $, $ y' $ denotes the first derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ x $, and $ a(x) $, $ b(x) $, $ c(x) $, and $ g(x) $ are given functions of $ x $. This is a second order linear differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a specific case where the coefficients $ a(x) $, $ b(x) $, $ c(x) $ and the function $ g(x) $ are constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 2y'' + 3y' + 5y = 7 $\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, the coefficients 2, 3, and 5 are constant coefficients, and 7 is the non-homogeneous term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the generic formula given above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ a(x) y'' $ represents the term involving the second derivative of the function $ y $.\n",
    "- $ b(x) y' $ represents the term involving the first derivative of the function $ y $.\n",
    "- $ c(x) y $ represents the term involving the function $ y $ itself.\n",
    "- $ g(x) $ on the right-hand side makes this a non-homogeneous linear differential equation. If $ g(x) $ were zero, it would be a homogeneous linear differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given specific case is a simpler form where the coefficients are constants, which often simplifies the solution process. There are various methods to solve linear differential equations depending on the specifics of the coefficients and the order of the equation."
