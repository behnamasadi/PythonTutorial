    "# Signal-to-noise Ratio\n",
    "The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the strength of a signal compared to the level of background noise present in the signal. It is expressed as a ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise, often measured in decibels (dB).\n",
    "\n",
    "A high SNR indicates that the signal is stronger relative to the noise, while a low SNR indicates that the signal is weaker and harder to distinguish from the noise.\n",
    "In digital image processing, a high SNR means that the image has a high level of detail and is free from visual noise, while a low SNR can result in grainy or blurred images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the SNR, various techniques can be used such as increasing the signal power, reducing noise sources, using noise filtering or suppression methods, and improving the signal detection or processing algorithms."
